Aflex is a lexical analyzer generating tool similar to the Unix tool lex.
It is upwardly compatible with alex 1.0.

CONTENTS:
The aflex directory contains the following files

./PORTING - Information on how to port aflex to a new Ada system.
./README - this informational file.
./RELEASE.NOTES - miscellaneous information about this version of aflex.
./VADS6.README - important information for users of Verdix 6.0 and SunAda 1.0
./change_suffix - a Bourne Shell script to rename source files.

./doc/aflex.man - a manual page for aflex.  Format with the command
	 nroff -man aflex.man

./doc/aflex_user_man.tex - a user manual for aflex.  Format with latex.

./src - this directory contains the source code for aflex (for VADS.)
./src/alsys_dos - sources specific to the Alsys compiler under MS/DOS.
./src/alsys_hp9000 - sources specific to the Alsys compiler on HP9000.
./src/alsys_sparc - sources specific to the Alsys compiler on Sparc.
./src/meridian_sparc - sources specific to the Meridian compiler on Sparc.
./src/telesoft - sources specific to the Telesoft compiler.
./src/ultrix - sources specific to the DecADA compiler under Ultrix.
./src/vaxvms - sources specific to the VAX/VMS Ada compiler.

COMPILING:

1. Create an ada library using the appropriate development system command
(for Verdix this is a.mklib, for Telesoft use acr) in the src directory.

2. *  If you are using Verdix you only need to type 'source compile'
     Edit the compile file to match the location of you Ada compiler if
     necessary.  If you are running under VADS version 6.0 you should use
     the VADS6.compile script to prevent optimization of a few files, since
     the optimizer breaks aflex.  If you are using this compiler you should
     also compile any output files that aflex generates (for file.l these
     would be file_dfa.a, file_io.a and file.a) using the -O0 (that's 
     dash-oh-zero) switch to prevent problems.

   * If you are using SunAda 1.0 you should also use follow the directions
     given above for VADS6.
 
   * If you are using Telesoft you need to use the change_suffix shell
     script to change the suffix on ada source files from .a to .ada.
     You now need to copy in the sources found in the src/telesoft
     directory, including the compile script.  You must also create a
     liblst.alb file.  Then 'source compile'.
   * If you are using a system listed above, go into that directory.
     See the README file for some information.   Any files you see
     there should be copied in the main source directory.  Compile
     scripts are also in this directory if the author included one.

   * If you are using another system read the PORTING file.

3.  You should now have an executable file.  Save copies of the
    distributed ascan_io.a, ascan_dfa.a and ascan.a.  Now use the
    executable to generate new versions of these files using the command
    aflex -is ascan.l. Check to make sure the generated files are the
    same as the distributed ones.  On a Unix system you can use the
    'diff' command to compare these files.
