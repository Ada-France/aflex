This directory contains changes to let aflex compile under Alsys V5 on
a  SPARCstation.  These changes were contributed by Rolf EBERT
<re@spinoza.enpc.fr> of Groupe Informatique Systemes Energetiques at the
Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussees.

Problems have been reported with the makefile in the alsys_sparc port,
however the Alsys make program is supposed to work.  The generated
scanners reference STANDARD_ERROR, so you need to set this up in
your own code.
