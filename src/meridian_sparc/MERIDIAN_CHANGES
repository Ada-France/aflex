changes made by andrew dunstan to make aflex work on meridian

(1) the main program must be a procedure, not a function.
(2) standard error had to be set up for aflex, in file_manager*.a - as
    /dev/tty
(3) standard error had to be set up for scanner in
    skeleton_templateB.a as /dev/tty
(4) ditto for template_managerB.a
(5) command line args had to be changed to use package arg in
    command_lineB.a.

Re stderr: it would be better to use the musix packages for stdandard
   error - then they would be able to be redirected. I will do this
   when I get time.
