-- TITLE template manager
-- AUTHOR: John Self (UCI)
-- DESCRIPTION supports output of internalized templates for the IO and DFA
--             packages.
-- NOTES This package is quite a memory hog, and is really only useful on
--       virtual memory systems.  It could use an external file to store the
--       templates like the skeleton manager.  This would save memory at the
--       cost of a slight reduction in speed and the necessity of keeping
--       copies of the template files in a known place.
