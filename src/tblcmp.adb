-- bldtbl - build table entries for dfa state
--
-- synopsis
--   int state[numecs], statenum, totaltrans, comstate, comfreq;
--   bldtbl( state, statenum, totaltrans, comstate, comfreq );
--
-- State is the statenum'th dfa state.  It is indexed by equivalence class and
-- gives the number of the state to enter for a given equivalence class.
-- totaltrans is the total number of transitions out of the state.  Comstate
-- is that state which is the destination of the most transitions out of State.
-- Comfreq is how many transitions there are out of State to Comstate.
--
-- A note on terminology:
--    "protos" are transition tables which have a high probability of
-- either being redundant (a state processed later will have an identical
-- transition table) or nearly redundant (a state processed later will have
-- many of the same out-transitions).  A "most recently used" queue of
-- protos is kept around with the hope that most states will find a proto
-- which is similar enough to be usable, and therefore compacting the
-- output tables.
--    "templates" are a special type of proto.  If a transition table is
-- homogeneous or nearly homogeneous (all transitions go to the same
-- destination) then the odds are good that future states will also go
-- to the same destination state on basically the same character set.
-- These homogeneous states are so common when dealing with large rule
-- sets that they merit special attention.  If the transition table were
-- simply made into a proto, then (typically) each subsequent, similar
-- state will differ from the proto for two out-transitions.  One of these
-- out-transitions will be that character on which the proto does not go
-- to the common destination, and one will be that character on which the
-- state does not go to the common destination.  Templates, on the other
-- hand, go to the common state on EVERY transition character, and therefore
-- cost only one difference.
